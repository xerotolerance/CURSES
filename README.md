Cj Maxwell presents the C-based Ubiquitiously Recursive Script for Evaluating Sudoku (CURSES).
Originally written for NJIT's Intensive Programming in Linux (CS 288) in Spring 2017, 
This C program takes a text representation of a sudoku puzzle (or link to such), recursively solves the puzzle (if solvable),
and displays the solution in a similiar format to standard output with debugging messages sent to standard error by default.
